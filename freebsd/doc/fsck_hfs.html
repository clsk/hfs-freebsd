<h2>fsck_hfs for FreeBSD</h2>

<h3>Status</h3>

	<p><code>fsck_hfs</code> is based on the corresponding utility from
	Darwin 6.6 (MacOS 10.2.6.)</p>

	<p>Unlike the original <code>fsck_hfs</code> from Darwin, this version
	works on little-endian architectures, as well.  Its filesystem
	verification and repair functionalities have been tested on i386.</p>

<h3>Known Problems and Limitations</h3>

	<p>Only devices with the block size of 512 bytes are supported.</p>

<h3>Plans for Improvement</h3>

	<p>Currently none.</p>
