<h1>HFS and HFS Plus in FreeBSD</h1>

<h2>An Important Note on the Current Status of This Project</h2>

	<p><b>With very little motivation left to keep this project alive,
	I'm looking for a volunteer who can take it over.  Until I find one,
	new releases of HFS for FreeBSD will be as likely as the rain in the
	desert.  Sorry.</b></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>HFS stands for the Hierarchical File System.
	<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Files/Files-99.html">HFS</a>
	and
	<a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html">HFS Plus</a>
	are the filesystem formats of
	<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html">Apple MacOS.</a>
	While the older one, HFS, may look rather limited today, HFS Plus
	includes most of the capabilities one can find in UFS or Berkeley FFS:
	long file names, hard and soft links, special nodes, owner and group
	information, access permissions.</p>

	<p>Additionally, both HFS and HFS Plus have a number of interesting
	features not found in UFS:</p>
	
	<ul>
	
		<li>They support so called <em>forks,</em> that is, multiple
		segments of data associated with a single file.  HFS supports
		as little as two forks per file, "data" and "resource."  HFS
		Plus was designed to allow for numerous named forks.  However,
		its current implementation limits this capability to the two
		aforementioned forks per file.</li>

		<li>Major internal structures of HFS and HFS Plus are kept as
		B-trees.  An HFS Plus volume essentially consists of a small
		header and a set of B-trees.  B-trees make many filesystem
		operations time-efficient.</li>

		<li>HFS Plus stores filenames in Unicode, thus supporting
		for multi-language environment.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Apple has recently released the original HFS kernel
	and userland code (incl. HFS Plus) under
	<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/">the Apple Public Source
	License [APSL]</a>
	as a part of Darwin, which created a nice opportunity to
	port it to FreeBSD.</p>

	<p>HFS and HFS Plus in FreeBSD may be of particular value to parties
	interested in sharing filesystem resources over a network from FreeBSD
	to MacOS, because there will be no need to emulate HFS-specific
	features unlike in the case of FFS backing store.</p>

	<p><em>Henceforth the term "HFS" will cover both HFS and HFS Plus
	unless explicitly specified otherwise.  To avoid misreading,
	the old HFS format will be denoted as "plain HFS."</em></p>

	<p><em>The term "port" used throughout this document means only that
	the HFS code has been ported from Darwin to FreeBSD; it has nothing
	to do with FreeBSD ports and packages (yet.)</em></p>

<h2>About This Port</h2>

	<!-- <h3>Overall Status</h3> -->

	<p>This port is based on the Darwin source code.  It's legal to
	use or develop it as long as
	<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/">the APSL terms</a>
	are kept.</p>

	<p><b>This port should be considered highly experimental and therefore
	used with caution.  Neither Apple nor the maintainer of this
	port will take responsibility for data loss or damage that
	might result from using this piece of software.</b></p>

<h2>Port Components</h2>

	<p>This port consists of the following functional parts:</p>

	<ul>
	
		<li><a href="kernel.html">A kernel module</a></li>

		<li>Userland Utilities:

		<ul>

			<li><a href="newfs_hfs.html">newfs_hfs</a></li>

			<li><a href="mount_hfs.html">mount_hfs</a></li>

			<li><a href="fsck_hfs.html">fsck_hfs</a></li>

		</ul>

	</ul>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

		<p>Your system should be at least as new as 5.0-RELEASE.</p>

		<p>To use MacOS-formatted disks, you will need
		FreeBSD-CURRENT as fresh as of the 24th of February, 2003
		(5.1-RELEASE will do);
		otherwise this port's usability will be limited
		to HFS volume images and volumes created within IBM
		PC (MBR) partitions.  To enable support of the MacOS disk
		format on architectures other that PowerPC, you will need
		to rebuild your kernel with the option <code>GEOM_APPLE</code>.
		This option is always enabled on the PowerPC
		architecture.  In -CURRENT, it is also available as
		a loadable module called <code>geom_apple</code>
		since the 31st of May, 2003.</p>

		<p>The kernel source must be installed at
		<code>/usr/src/sys.</code></p>

		<p>The source code of <code>mount(8)</code> must be
		installed at <code>/usr/src/sbin/mount.</code></p>

	<h3>Building and Installing</h3>

		<pre><code>
	# tar xzf hfs-freebsd-xx.tar.gz
	# cd hfs-freebsd-xx
	# make
	# make install
		</code></pre>

	<h3>Using</h3>
		
		<pre><code>
	# mount -t hfs /dev/da0s3 /mnt
		</code></pre>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

	<p>The GEOM_APPLE module will allocate the first slice of a
	MacOS-formatted disk to
	the partition map itself since the latter is self-contained.
	The first of conventional partitions will appear at slice 2.
	That partition may contain drivers or auxiliary
	data instead of a disk volume; GEOM_APPLE can't distinguish
	between them yet.  You may have to look at the beginning of a
	partition with hexdump(1) to tell if it's an HFS
	volume&mdash;a 'BD' or 'H+' signature must appear at offset 0x400.
	On the other hand, it's all right to try to mount an obscure
	partition as an HFS volume; the driver will simply refuse
	it if it's not HFS.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2>

	<h3>Managing your iPod from FreeBSD</h3>

		<p>If you have an iPod formatted for Mac, you can
		access its files from FreeBSD as well.  Eirik Oeverby
		&lt;ltning at anduin dot net&gt;
		reports that it's possible to connect an iPod to a FreeBSD
		host through FireWire.  Of course, you'll need to load
		the FireWire driver in advance.</p>

		<p>The entire disk of your iPod will be accessible as
		<code>/dev/daX</code>, where <code>X</code> is a number
		assigned to this new device upon plugging it.
		The GEOM_APPLE module will further split the disk into
		<code>/dev/daXs1</code>, a partition map partition
		(yes, it's self-contained); <code>/dev/daXs2</code>,
		a firmware partition; and <code>/dev/daXs3</code>,
		an HFS Plus volume partition.  Obviously, you should
		mount the latter.</p>

		<p>Eirik also reports that he had been unable to mount
		the HFS volume of his iPod until he took his chance with
		repairing it using
		<a href="fsck_hfs.html">the port of fsck_hfs.</a>
		Beware of iPod firmware bugs silently eating the
		file system!</p>

		<p>Note that you'll need software to manage the iTunes
		database on your iPod, or else audio files uploaded
		won't show up in your iPod playlist.  There's a number
		of open-source projects around dedicated to that.
		Look for myPod, gtkPod, or whatever.</p>
