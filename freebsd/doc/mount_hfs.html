<h2>mount_hfs for FreeBSD</h2>

<h3>Status</h3>

	<p><code>mount_hfs</code> was written to accommodate FreeBSD
	peculiarities and is covered by the BSD license.</p>

<h3>Known Problems</h3>

	<p>The mask option <code>(-m)</code> doesn't work in the case
	of HFS Plus.</p>

<h3>Plans for Improvement</h3>

	<p>Move all HFS mount flags from the mount(2) <code>flags</code>
	argument to the filesystem-specific argument.</p>

	<p>Separate the mask option <code>(-m)</code> into two
	options, one for files and the other for directories.
	[Suggested by Matthew N. Dodd]</p>

	<p>Add an option to force case-sensitive mode.
